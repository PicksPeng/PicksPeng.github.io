I'm a graduate student at [Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/ "UMD CS"). I'm also affiliated to [Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS)](https://quics.umd.edu/ "QuICS"). I'm currently advised by Prof. [Xiaodi Wu](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~xwu/ "Xiaodi Wu"). My researches focus on theoretical and practical explorations of high-assurance software toolchains for quantum computing. I'm also broadly interested in programming languages, quantum computing and physics.

In 2019, I received a Bachelor of Engineering from Institute for Interdiscplinary Information Science, Tsinghua University, and a Bachelor of Science (secondary degree) from Department of Mathematical Science, Tsinghua University.
